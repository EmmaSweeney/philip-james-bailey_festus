			<h2 epub:type="title">Preface to the American Edition</h2>
			<p>We here present to the American public a book which has produced no little sensation in England, and which has been, for some time, known to many in this country. But although the first edition was issued six years since, it has had but a limited circulation among us; and it is believed that in re-publishing <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Festus</i>, we not only perform a work which its merits demand, but open, for the first time, to many who will appreciate it, a great and original poem. The peculiar value of the second English edition, from which this is printed, consists in the “Proem,” which was not attached to the first. Having placed at the end of the volume some of the highest literary opinions in England, we will not intrude any analysis of our own. But a word upon one point With many minds, it will be difficult to acquit the author from the charge of irreverence. For this purpose, we refer to his vindication in the “Proem” and in the body of the work; by which the reader will perceive that he is free from irreverence in spirit, whatever question there may be as to the propriety of certain forms of expression. As to the extravagances, which all will discover, they are the extravagances of deep and eloquent passion⁠—the luxuriant overgrowth of a profoundly rich soil. With all its faults, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Festus</i> is a great poem⁠—a mine of thought and imagery. It is perfectly safe to pronounce it one of the most powerful and splendid productions of the age.</p>
