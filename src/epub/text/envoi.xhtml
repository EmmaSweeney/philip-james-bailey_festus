			<p>
				<span>Read this, world! He who writes is dead to thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But still lives in these leaves. He spake inspired:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Night and day, thought came unhelped, undesired,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like blood to his heart. The course of study he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went through was of the soul-rack. The degree</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He took was high: it was wise wretchedness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He suffered perfectly, and gained no less</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A prize than, in his own torn heart, to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A few bright seeds: he sowed them⁠—hoped them truth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The autumn of that seed is in these pages.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">God was with him, and bade old Time, to the youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unclench his heart, and teach the book of ages.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Peace to thee, world!⁠—farewell! May God the Power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And God the Love⁠—and God the Grace, be ours!</span>
